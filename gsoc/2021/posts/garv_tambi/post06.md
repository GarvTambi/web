# **Advanced Lane Lines on Carla Simulator**

**Advanced Lane Finding on the Road**

The video below talks about how I process the input stream and the steps involved to build an image processing pipeline that gives filling area between left lines and right lines.

**Advanced Lane Finding Finding**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:

* Compute the camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients of given images.
* Apply a distortion correction to raw images.
* Use color transforms, gradients, etc., to create a thresholded binary image.
* Apply a perspective transform to rectify binary image ("birds-eye view").
* Detect lane pixels and fit to find the lane boundary.
* Determine the curvature of the lane and vehicle position with respect to center.
* Warp the detected lane boundaries back onto the original image.
* Output visual display of the lane boundaries and numerical estimation of lane curvature and vehicle position.
