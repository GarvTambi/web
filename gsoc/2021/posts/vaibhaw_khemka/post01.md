# GSoC'21 RoboComp project: Monocular depth estimation from RGB signals

19th June, 2021

## About me
I am Vaibhaw Khemka,3rd year undergraduate pursuing by B.TECH at IIT Hyderabad. I have a huge interest in Robotics and Deep Learning which aligns with that of Robocomp. This is my first time in GSoC and having a great summer.


## About the Project
Depth Estimation is one of the attractive research areas in computer vision. The motivation of this project is to estimate depth without the use of LIDAR sensors or other related costly setups in real-time especially for indoors which involves complex scenes. And it also makes the robot more robust and efficient to carry out any task.
