# HIGH QUALITY MONOCULAR DEPTH ESTIMATION FOR REAL-TIME
## WORKFLOW
* Challenges: 
1. Trade off between Accuracy and Speed of the model - If model accuracy is high,Speed decreases for the prediction and vice-versa. <br />
2. Training on [NYU dataset](https://cs.nyu.edu/~silberman/datasets/nyu_depth_v2.html) which involves complex indoor scenes. So, Model should be Generalizable and robust. <br />
* Evaluating on Available Pretrained Models on the basis of Depth Map Quality and Inference Time for 1 frame(on CPU)
* If Results are not good, Creating my own light-weight architecture/model for predicting High Quality Depth Map in Real-Time.
* Preparing the NYU Dataset
* Training the Model 
* Evaluating the Results on the basis of quality Depth Map and Inference Time.

**C) Dense Depth (NOT REAL TIME, HIGH QUALITY DEPTH)**

Most of the available models are trained on [KITTI dataset](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/) which gave bad results on indoor scenes due to its complexity in scenes.<br />
And Models trained on NYU dataset either give High Quality Depth Map or Real-Time prediction.<br />
Thus, A new model is created which will give both High Quality Depth Map and Real-Time prediction named as *MobDepth*

## RESULTS OF MY MODELS (named as MobDepth)
